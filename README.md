# IMPORTANT GUIDE

Build your own Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that uses a set of smart contracts to execute trades. It is an open source project and falls into the category of a DeFi product because it uses smart contracts to facilitate trades.


Uniswap is a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) product, meaning it operates without a central authority like traditional exchanges. Instead of relying on intermediaries or order books, it uses automated market makers (AMMs)—smart contracts that determine the price of assets based on supply and demand. When a user makes a trade, the smart contract automatically executes it by utilizing liquidity pools, which are filled by other users providing their assets in exchange for rewards.

Since it’s open-source, anyone can access the code, deploy it, and customize it to create their own version of Uniswap or similar decentralized exchanges.

In short, building your own Uniswap allows you to replicate this decentralized and trustless exchange system using smart contracts and AMMs, enabling users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other on the blockchain.
